# The-Golden-Age-of-Video-Games

***

# Introduction
To complete the Data Analyst in SQL track on Datacamp, I had to undertake a project.
In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released between 1977 and 2020. 
My aim was to pinpoint the era in which video games reached their peak satisfaction among users and critics. 
Additionally, I explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

# Background
Video games are big business - the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027 according to Mordor Intelligence. 
With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. 
But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?
